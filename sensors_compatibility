c
Copy code
#include "stm32f4xx_hal.h"

I2C_HandleTypeDef hi2c1;

void SystemClock_Config(void);
static void MX_GPIO_Init(void);
static void MX_I2C1_Init(void);

int main(void) {
  HAL_Init();
  SystemClock_Config();
  MX_GPIO_Init();
  MX_I2C1_Init();

  while (1) {
    // Read data from the I2C sensor
    // Modify this part based on the sensor's datasheet and library
    HAL_Delay(1000);
  }
}

void SystemClock_Config(void) {
  // System Clock Configuration
  // Configure the system clock
}

static void MX_I2C1_Init(void) {
  // I2C1 initialization
  hi2c1.Instance = I2C1;
  hi2c1.Init.ClockSpeed = 100000;
  hi2c1.Init.DutyCycle = I2C_DUTYCYCLE_2;
  hi2c1.Init.OwnAddress1 = 0;
  hi2c1.Init.AddressingMode = I2C_ADDRESSINGMODE_7BIT;
  hi2c1.Init.DualAddressMode = I2C_DUALADDRESS_DISABLE;
  hi2c1.Init.OwnAddress2 = 0;
  hi2c1.Init.GeneralCallMode = I2C_GENERALCALL_DISABLE;
  hi2c1.Init.NoStretchMode = I2C_NOSTRETCH_DISABLE;
  if (HAL_I2C_Init(&hi2c1) != HAL_OK) {
    // Initialization Error
    Error_Handler();
  }
}

void Error_Handler(void) {
  // Error handler code
}

#ifdef USE_FULL_ASSERT
void assert_failed(uint8_t *file, uint32_t line) {
  // User can add his own implementation to report the file name and line number
}
#endif
Modify the code above according to your sensor's specifications and STM32 microcontroller model. Be sure to consult the datasheets and reference manuals for both the STM32 microcontroller and the sensors you choose for accurate configuration and integration
